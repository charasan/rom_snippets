# My Old ROM MUD Snippets
If you float around collecting these kind of things, you might have seen this code sitting in some ROM snippet collections in the dark areas of the web. As long as they kept my header in the files with my email address, I was ok with that. I am, however, the original author, so I am going to put them in my GitHub, so I can look back and remember I once did things like this.

By the way, if you're keeping score at home, in the 20+ years this code has been around, total number of thank you emails I've received: 1.

I kept the original headers in the files because, hey, they're in the ones floating around out there (the ones that weren't stolen, stripped or rewritten, anyway) - so it helps tie them to me, I guess. Plus it's a bit of nostalgia.

Also, you'll see "\<G\>" a lot - this was pre-emoji days - I used <G> to denote a smilie/sarcasm in a remark, usually at the end of a sentence.

UPDATE: I've converted the old files from the 90s into proper patch files and moved the originals into the archive folder.
